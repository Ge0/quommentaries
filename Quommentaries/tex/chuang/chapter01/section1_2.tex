\subsection{Section 1.2}
\subsubsection{Qubit representation in a Bloch Sphere}

The explanation to the following formula is not given by the book.

\[
\ket{\psi} = e^{i \gamma} \left(
    cos \frac{\theta}{2}\ket{0} + e^{i \varphi} sin \frac{\theta}{2} \ket{1}
\right)
\]

However, \href{https://github.com/victoragnez}{Agnez} came up with a simple explanation using spherical coordinates. Its details can be found at \href{https://www.google.com/}{TODO: add link to Computer Society}
